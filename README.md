# Byte_2_Clean

### Overview
`Byte_2_Clean` is a Python application designed to scan directories for duplicate files using various hashing techniques. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter` and supports multiple hashing algorithms to identify and remove duplicates.

### Features
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface for specifying directories and selecting hashing techniques.
- **Hashing Techniques**: Supports multiple hashing algorithms for scanning:
  - **SHA-256**: Secure but slower.
  - **xxhash.xxh64**: Faster but less secure.
  - **xxhash.xxh32**: Fastest but least secure.
- **Progress Tracking**: Saves and loads scan progress, allowing for efficient rescanning and preventing reprocessing of files.
- **Detailed Logging**: Real-time logging in the GUI during scanning and deletion of files.
- **Delete Functionality**: Options to delete selected or all duplicate files.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6** or higher.

#### Install Required Packages
Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install xxhash
```

### Setup

#### Clone the Repository
Clone the `Byte_2_Clean` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4lp1ne/Byte_2_Clean.git
```

#### Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd Byte_2_Clean
```

#### Run the Application
Start the GUI application by running the Python script:

```bash
python b2c.py
```

### Requirements
Make sure the following Python packages are installed:
- **xxhash**: For fast and very fast hashing techniques.
- **tkinter**: Pre-installed with Python, used for the graphical user interface.

If you are managing dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file, create the following file:

#### `requirements.txt`
```
xxhash
```

You can install the requirements using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using the GUI
1. **Directory Path**: Enter or select the directory you wish to scan.
2. **Select Hashing Technique**: Choose from the dropdown:
   - `"Secure"` for SHA-256 (secure but slower).
   - `"Thorough"` for xxhash.xxh64 (faster but less secure).
   - `"Quick"` for xxhash.xxh32 (fastest but least secure).
3. **Start Scan**: Click the "Start Scan" button to begin the scan.
4. **View Duplicates**: After scanning, select an original file and click "Display Duplicates of Selected Original" to view duplicates.
5. **Delete Duplicates**:
   - Use "Delete Selected Duplicates" to remove selected duplicates.
   - Use "Delete All Duplicates" to remove all duplicates found in the scan.
6. **Open Folder**: Select a file and click "Open Containing Folder" to open the folder containing the selected file.
7. **Log Output**: View real-time logs showing progress and detailed information.

### Code Description

#### Main Functions
- **save_progress(progress)**: Saves the scan progress to a JSON file for resuming later.
- **load_progress()**: Loads saved scan progress to prevent reprocessing already scanned files.
- **compute_hash(file_path, hash_func_cls)**: Computes the hash of a file using the selected hashing algorithm.
- **scan_for_duplicates(directory, mode)**: Scans the specified directory for duplicate files based on the selected hashing mode.
- **delete_selected_duplicates()**: Deletes only the selected duplicate files.
- **delete_all_duplicates()**: Deletes all duplicates found during the scan.
- **open_folder_containing_file()**: Opens the folder where a selected file resides.
- **append_log(message)**: Adds messages to the GUIâ€™s log output to display the scanning and deletion processes.
- **run_scan()**: Runs the scanning process in a separate thread, ensuring the GUI remains responsive during long scans.
- **start_scan()**: Starts the scan when the "Start Scan" button is pressed.

#### GUI Elements
- **Directory Path Input**: Input box for specifying the directory to be scanned.
- **Hashing Technique Dropdown**: Dropdown to select the hashing method (SHA-256, xxhash.xxh64, xxhash.xxh32).
- **Log Output**: A scrollable text box that displays real-time logs during scanning and deletion.
- **Buttons**:
  - **Start Scan**: Initiates the scanning process.
  - **Display Duplicates of Selected Original**: Displays duplicates of the selected original file.
  - **Open Containing Folder**: Opens the folder of the selected file.
  - **Delete Selected Duplicates**: Deletes the duplicates selected by the user.
  - **Delete All Duplicates**: Deletes all detected duplicate files.
  - **Reset Progress**: Resets the scan progress by deleting the saved progress file.

### Troubleshooting

- **GUI Freezes**: Ensure the scan process runs in a separate thread. If the GUI becomes unresponsive, verify that no other processes are blocking file I/O.
- **Errors Reading Files**: Check file permissions and verify that the directory path is correct.
